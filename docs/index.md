## What this is

Flakes is the definitive web framework for building web applications in Python. It takes inspiration from other web frameworks such as [NextJS](https://nextjs.org), [Svelte/SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev), and even some Python web frameworks such as [FastHTML](https://fastht.ml).

With Flakes, you can create fast, reactive, scaleable web applications in a syntax, which is nearly identical to Python, requirng minimal effort to learn, allowing you to spend more time coding.
